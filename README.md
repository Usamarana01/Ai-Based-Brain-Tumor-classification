Developed a full-stack web application that integrates an advanced AI model for brain tumour classification and grade prediction from MRI scans. This project not only delivers highly accurate diagnostic predictions but also provides an end-to-end solution for clinicians and patients by incorporating patient history management, data security.

Key Highlights:
✅ AI Model Development:
 • Designed and trained a state-of-the-art CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras, achieving high accuracy in tumour detection and grade prediction.

✅ Seamless Integration with Web Application:
 • Integrated the AI model into a robust Flask backend, enabling real-time inference directly through the website.

✅ History Management Module:
 • Implemented a feature that securely stores users’ prediction history, allowing authenticated users to review and compare past results.

✅ Patient Data Confidentiality:
 • Ensured strict data privacy by allowing only authenticated users to access their own patient data, thereby protecting sensitive information.

✅ Educational Resources & Community Engagement:
 • Added blogs and educational content to inform users about brain tumours, diagnosis procedures, and treatment options.
 • Developed a discussion forum for Q&A, fostering community support and knowledge sharing.

✅ Dynamic Pricing Module:
 • Implemented a pricing system that offers 5 free predictions per day for new users, with a subscription prompt after exceeding the limit.
 • Integrated subscription plans using Stripe for seamless and secure payment processing.

✅ Integrated Medical Chatbot:
 • Deployed a Llama 3 8B medical chatbot to provide real-time assistance and answer user queries, enhancing the overall user experience.
Technologies & Tools:
Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras (CNN-based model)
Backend Development: Flask (Python)
Frontend & UI: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (frameworks as applicable)
Payment Integration: Stripe
Chatbot Integration: Llama 3 8B
