        "content": "<p>A brain tumor is a cluster of abnormal cells that grows out of control in your brain. Some brain tumors are benign, which means the cells aren’t cancer. Others are malignant, meaning they’re cancer.</p><p>Brain tumors are called primary tumors if they started in your brain. They’re considered secondary if they started somewhere else in your body and spread to your brain.</p><h2>Types of Brain Tumors</h2><p>Primary brain tumors come from cells that make up the brain and central nervous system. They’re named for the kind of cell in which they first form. There are more than 100 kinds of brain tumors. The most common types in adults are:</p><ul><li><strong>Gliomas:</strong> These tumors start in the glial cells, which are cells that help keep nerves healthy. They’re most often cancer. There are several categories of gliomas, based on which specific cells they target. Astrocytomas are most common in adults. A glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of glial tumor.</li><li><strong>Meningiomas:</strong> These form in the meninges, the thin layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord. They aren’t cancer, but they can cause problems by pressing on your brain.</li><li><strong>Schwannomas:</strong> These damage the protective coating of nerve cells. They aren’t cancer, but they often cause hearing loss or problems with balance.</li><li><strong>Pituitary adenomas:</strong> These form on the pituitary gland, which sits at the base of your brain. It makes important hormones. These tumors usually aren’t cancer and are slow growing.</li></ul><h2>Benign vs. Malignant Brain Tumors</h2><p>Benign brain tumors aren’t aggressive and normally don’t spread to surrounding tissues, although they can be serious and even life-threatening. Benign brain tumors usually have clearly defined borders and usually aren’t deeply rooted in brain tissue. This makes them easier to surgically remove if they’re in an area of the brain where it’s safe to operate. But they can come back. Benign tumors are less likely to come back than cancerous ones.</p><p>Even a benign brain tumor can be a serious health problem. Brain tumors can damage the cells around them by causing inflammation and putting increased pressure on nearby tissue, as well as inside your skull.</p><p><strong>Malignant primary brain tumors</strong> are cancers that start in your brain, typically grow faster than benign tumors, and quickly invade surrounding tissue. Although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs, it can spread to other parts of your brain and central nervous system.</p><p>Secondary brain tumors are cancer. They come from cancer that started somewhere else in your body and spread, or metastasized, to your brain. About 1 in 4 people with cancer develop a secondary brain tumor.</p><h2>Brain Tumor Symptoms</h2><p>Symptoms of brain tumors vary according to the type of tumor and the location. Because different areas of the brain control different functions of the body, where the tumor lies affects the symptoms you get.</p><p>Some tumors have no symptoms until they’re large and then cause a serious, rapid decline in health. Other tumors may have symptoms that develop slowly.</p><p>Common symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Headaches, which may not get better with the usual headache remedies. You may notice you’re getting them more often or they’re worse than usual.</li><li>Seizures, particularly in a person who doesn't have a history of seizures</li><li>Changes in speech or hearing</li><li>Changes in vision</li><li>Balance problems</li><li>Problems with walking</li><li>Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs</li><li>Problems with memory</li><li>Personality changes</li><li>Inability to concentrate</li><li>Weakness in one part of the body</li><li>Morning vomiting without nausea</li></ul><p>These symptoms can result from many conditions. Don't assume you have a brain tumor just because you have some of the symptoms. Check with your doctor.</p><h2>Brain Tumor Diagnosis</h2><p>Most of the time, doctors can’t tell what causes a brain tumor. There are only a few known risk factors for brain tumors in adults.</p><ul><li>Exposure to radiation. Children who receive radiation to the head have a higher risk of developing a brain tumor as adults.</li><li>Family history. Some brain tumors are linked to certain rare genetic conditions such as neurofibromatosis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</li><li>Age. People between ages 65 and 79 make up the population most likely to be diagnosed with a brain tumor.</li><li>No history of chickenpox. One study has found that people who had chickenpox are less likely to get gliomas.</li></ul><h2>Brain Tumor Diagnosis</h2><p>To diagnose a brain tumor, your doctor will start by asking questions about your symptoms, overall health, and family health history. Then they’ll do a physical exam, including a neurological exam. If there's reason to suspect a brain tumor, the doctor may request one or more of the following tests:</p><ul><li>Imaging studies like a CT scan or MRI to see detailed images of the brain</li><li>Angiogram or MRA, which use dye and X-rays of blood vessels in the brain to look for signs of a tumor or abnormal blood vessels</li><li>The doctor may also ask for a biopsy to see if the tumor is cancer. They’ll remove a tissue sample from your brain. They might do it during surgery to remove the tumor. Or they could insert a needle through a small hole drilled into your skull. They’ll send the sample to a lab for testing.</li></ul><h2>Brain Tumor Treatment</h2><p>Your doctor will consider several things in deciding how to treat your brain tumor, including:</p><ul><li>Location of the tumor</li><li>Size of the tumor</li><li>Type of tumor</li><li>Whether the tumor has spread</li><li>Your overall health</li><li>Potential complications</li></ul><p>"

         "content": "<p>This page was reviewed under our medical and editorial policy by <strong>Maurie Markman, MD, President, Medicine & Science</strong></p><p>This page was updated on June 8, 2022.</p><p>The staging process assesses the spread of cancer beyond the original site. Brain cancer does not behave in the same way as other cancers. Tumors may migrate within the brain, but it is very rare for primary brain tumors to spread outside of the brain, or away from the central nervous system (CNS).</p><p>Consequently, brain cancer is usually graded rather than staged. The brain tumor grading system features four distinct grades and provides your care team with an understanding of how the tumor grows. This process helps doctors match brain cancer treatments to individual needs.</p><h2>Assessing Brain Tumors</h2><p>To determine the growth and development of tumors in the brain, doctors focus on the characteristics of the tumor and its effect on functionality. The main factors used to assess brain tumors include:</p><ul><li><strong>Size and location</strong></li><li><strong>Type of tissue or cells affected</strong></li><li><strong>Resectability</strong> (the likelihood that part or all of the tumor can be removed by surgery)</li><li><strong>The spread of the cancer within the brain or spinal cord</strong></li><li><strong>The possibility the cancer has spread beyond the brain or CNS</strong></li></ul><p>A complete assessment will also factor in age and brain cancer symptoms that are limiting basic functions, such as speech, hearing or movement.</p><p>Brain cancer grading is much different than staging other cancers in the body. Cancers in the lung, colon and breast are staged based on their location in the body, size, lymph node involvement and possible spread. Tumors in the brain are graded based on how aggressive the tumor cells appear under a microscope.</p><p>The grade and resectability of the tumor (or the ability to remove it with surgery) will help guide treatment decisions. Surgery depends on the tumor’s accessibility (location), size, extent (spread within the brain) and the patient’s overall health (including medical history).</p><h2>How Many Grades Does Brain Cancer Have?</h2><p>Brain cancer is categorized into four grades. They are:</p><ul><li><strong>Grade 1 brain cancer:</strong> The tumor grows slowly and rarely spreads into nearby tissues. It may be possible to completely remove the tumor with surgery.</li><li><strong>Grade 2 brain cancer:</strong> The tumor grows slowly but may spread into nearby tissues or recur.</li><li><strong>Grade 3 brain cancer:</strong> The tumor grows quickly, is likely to spread into nearby tissues, and the tumor cells look very different from normal cells.</li><li><strong>Grade 4 brain cancer:</strong> The tumor grows and spreads very quickly, and the tumor cells do not look like normal cells.</li></ul><h2>Brain Metastasis</h2><p>Secondary brain tumors, which have spread to the brain from another location in the body, are much more common than primary brain tumors. These tumors are also becoming increasingly more common as individuals do better with cancer treatment and live longer, giving the original cancer the opportunity to spread to the brain.</p><p>Some cancers that commonly spread to the brain are lung, breast, colon, kidney, melanoma, thyroid and uterine. Lung cancer is the most common form of brain metastasis. In fact, lung cancer staging often involves a brain scan.</p><p>Brain metastases will likely be assessed through the Tumor, Node, Metastasized (spread) staging system (TNM). Sometimes, individuals are diagnosed with brain or spinal metastases before they realize they have another, primary cancer.</p><h2>Brain Cancer Treatment: The Care You Need Is One Call Away</h2><p>Your multidisciplinary team will work with you to develop a personalized plan to treat your brain cancer in a way that fits your individual needs and goals.</p><h2>Diagnosing Cancer</h2><h2>Brain Cancer Survival Rate</h2><p>The average five-year relative survival rate for malignant brain tumors is 35.6 percent, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. This means that 35.6 percent of people who are diagnosed with brain cancer are still alive five years after their tumor is found.</p><p>Many factors affect survival following a brain cancer diagnosis, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Age</strong></li><li><strong>Tumor type</strong></li><li><strong>Grade</strong></li></ul><p>For example, according to the American Cancer Society, the five-year relative survival rate by age bracket for glioblastoma, the most common type of primary malignant brain tumor, is:</p><ul><li>22 percent for people aged 20 to 44</li><li>9 percent for people aged 45 to 54</li><li>6 percent for people aged 55 to 64</li></ul><p>This means that the younger you are, the higher the estimate of survival after five years. As a general rule, survival is longer with lower-grade brain tumors, but brain cancer survival data isn’t often categorized by grade.</p><p>It’s also important to keep in mind that survival estimates are just that—estimates. They are based on past data and older treatments. Advances continue to be made in medicine, and you should feel comfortable asking your care team to go over what these estimates mean for you, and what newer treatments may be appropriate for you.</p>"
